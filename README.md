### Requirements
- JDK 21+
- Lombok configured on IDE
    - http://ganeshtiwaridotcomdotnp.blogspot.com/2016/03/configuring-lombok-on-intellij.html
    - For eclipse, download the lombok jar, run it, and point to eclipse installation
- Maven
- Docker 
  - Make sure docker is started and running
  - Run `$ sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock` if you get error like this "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running? (Details: [13] Permission denied)"


## Build and create docker image

`sh build-docker-images.sh`

## Run all apps and dependencies using docker-compose 

- Run ```docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up``` at root to run all apps and dependencies and open localhost:8081 to access main app


## How to Run apps individually

It contains following applications:

- main-app
- email-service (optional)
- report-service (optional)
- trend-service (optional)
- content-checker (optional)

# Note you will need to create a database named 'seedapp' in your mysql server

Option 1 - run with manually started  KeyCloak, ActiveMQ and MySQL  servers
- Run ```mvn clean install``` at root 
- Run ```docker compose -f docker/docker-compose-dev.yml up``` at root to start docker containers
- Go to main-app folder and run ```mvn``` to start the application


Option 2 - run from IDE
- import into your IDE and compile the full project and run the Application.java on main-app module
- Update run configuration to run maven goal `wro4j:run` Before Launch. It should be after 'Build'


## Run Tests (use ./mvnw instead of mvn if you want to use maven wrapper)

    Test uses TestContainers, which requires Docker to be installed locally.

##### Running full tests

`mvn clean verify`

##### Running unit tests only (it uses maven surefire plugin)

`mvn  compiler:testCompile resources:testResources  surefire:test`

##### Running integration tests only (it uses maven-failsafe-plugin)

`mvn  compiler:testCompile resources:testResources  failsafe:integration-test`

## Code Quality

##### The `error-prone` runs at compile time.

##### The `modernizer` `checkstyle` and `spotbugs` plugin are run as part of maven `test-compile` lifecycle phase. use `mvn spotbugs:gui' to

##### SonarQube scan

Run sonarqube server using docker
`docker run -e SONAR_ES_BOOTSTRAP_CHECKS_DISABLE=true -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:latest`

Perform scan:
`mvn sonar:sonar`
mvn sonar:sonar -Dsonar.login=admin -Dsonar.password=admin

View Reports in SonarQube web ui:

- visit http://localhost:9000
- default login and password are `admin`, you will be asked to change password after logging in with default
  username/password
- (optional) change sonarqube admin password without logging
  in: `curl -u admin:admin -X POST "http://localhost:9000/api/users/change_password?login=admin&previousPassword=admin&password=NEW_PASSWORD"`
- if you change the password, make sure the update `-Dsonar.password=admin` when you run sonarqube next time

### Dependency vulnerability scan

Owasp dependency check plugin is configured. Run `mvn dependency-check:check` to run scan and
open `dependency-check-report.html` from target to see the report.


## Run Tests Faster by using parallel maven build
`mvn -T 5 clean package`


Once the application starts, open  `http://localhost:8081` on your browser. The default username/passwords are listed on : gt.app.Application.initData, which are:

- system/pass
- user1/pass
- user2/pass
